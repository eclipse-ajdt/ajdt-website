	<introduction>
		<html:div>
<html:p>
AJDT released 2.1.0 to coincide with the Eclipse Helios release in late June.  There are two streams,
of this version, one for Eclipse 3.5, with version 2.2.0.e34x-*, and one for Eclipse 3.6 with version 2.1.0.e35x-*.
These two streams are maintained as separate branches in CVS.  Because of the tight integration of AJDT with JDT, 
the Eclipse 3.5 stream will not install in Eclipse 3.6 and vice versa.  On top of that, the 3.6 stream uses a 
new APIs available in the PDE project so that AspectJ PDE builds are easier to create. Excepting these differences, 
the two streams use the same code base and have the same feature set.  The 2.1.1 release is the last 
scheduled version targeting the Eclipse 3.5 stream.  There will be no more changes to this stream unless a 
critical bug is discovered and fixed.  We are planning to release AJDT version 2.2.0 for the Eclipse 3.7 stream
to coincide with the Indigo release in June 2011, and we will begin to release development snapshots of this
stream in March 2011.

				AJDT includes 6 plugins from two other EPL Eclipse.org projects:
				<html:ul>
					<html:li>
						The
						<html:a
							href="http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?projectid=tools.aspectj">AspectJ project</html:a>
						contributes three plugins.
						These plugins are
						<html:em>org.aspectj.runtime</html:em>
						, which contains the AspectJ runtime,
						<html:em>org.aspectj.ajde</html:em>
						, which contains AspectJ support for integrating with a
						development environment,
						and
						<html:em>org.aspectj.weaver</html:em>
						, which contains the AspectJ weaver and compiler.
					</html:li>

					<html:li>
						The
						<html:a
							href="http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/incubator/aspects/index.php">Equinox Aspects project</html:a>
						, part of the Eqinox Incubator also contributes three plugins.
						These are
						<html:em>org.eclipse.equinox.weaving.aspectj
						</html:em>
						, which contains the equinox weaving service,
						<html:em>org.eclipse.equinox.weaving.hook
						</html:em>
						, which contains the OSGi framework extension for the weaving
						service to plug in, and
						<html:em>org.eclipse.equinox.weaving.source
						</html:em>
						, which contains Equinox Aspects source code.

			<html:div>Service refresh of AJDT for the 3.6 stream.  
			First stable development release targeting Eclipse 3.7.  This is meant for early adopters,

	<target_environments>
		<html:div>AJDT 2.1.0.e35x-* requires Eclipse 3.5 and AJDT 2.1.0.e36x-* requires Eclipse 3.6.  As such, AJDT has the same JRE requirements as Eclipse.</html:div>
		<internationalization>
			<html:div>English language bundles are available for many AJDT messages, but they have not been translated.

	<compatibility_with_previous_releases>
		<html:div>ADJT versions are designed to be backwards compatible with older versions of the same stream.  However, since different streams 
		run on different Eclipse versions, there is no compatibility between streams, even though the feature sets are largely the same.</html:div>

		<themes_and_priorities> 
		<preamble>
			<html:div>Our current focus is three-fold: Intertype innertype
				support, refactoring support, and IDE support for load-time weaving. 
				These themes are generated
				from user requests in the community. As such, we want
				to maintain flexibility and put effort into new themes if they are
				coherently generated from the community.
			</html:div>
		</preamble>
		<theme name="Intertype Innertype support (ITIT)">
			<description>
				<html:p>
					Third party projects such as <html:a href="http://sringsource.org/roo">ROO</html:a>	are pushing the
					limits of intertype declaration (ITD) functionality both in the compiler and the editor.  Since this is a highly visible project
					with many potential users, we would like to encourage its adoption by facilitating the ITD editor support 
					that it requires.
				</html:p>
				<html:p>
				  A new feature of AspectJ 1.6.9 is <html:a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/310501">intertype inner types</html:a>.
				  This is feature has required changes to the AspectJ grammar.  As such, it has large ripple effects throughout
				  AJDT.  We need to support things like reconciling, navigation, content assist, search, and refactoring of ITITs.

		<theme name="Refactoring support">
			<description>
				<html:p>
				AJDT is a relatively mature programming language tool.  As such, users have high expectations of it.  They
				expect a similar level of tooling support as they receive from JDT.  One of the weaker areas of AJDT is refactoring.
				For the 2.1.0 release, we have added new support for renaming ITDs, but there are still problems with the renaming
				of pointcuts and the types and methods within them.

		<theme name="IDE support for Load Time Weaving (LTW)">
			<description>
				<html:p>
					Currently, aspects applied to a project through LTW are not visible in the
					editor in the standard ways that compile time aspects are. These
					include
					gutter annotations and entries in the crosscutting view. Because there is
					no editing support, using LTW can be time consuming and
					error-prone. We will
					explore ways to gather and display LTW information to the programmer while
					editing.
