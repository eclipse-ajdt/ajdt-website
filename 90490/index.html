<h2>New Crosscutting Comparison functionality (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=90490">bug 90490</a>)</h2>

<p>
  This page introduces the new Crosscutting Comparison view and related
  functionality. This is available in AJDT development builds with versions of
  1.2.1.20050627142749 onwards, which can be obtained from the
  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ajdt/downloads/#dev">downloads page</a>
  for either Eclipse 3.0 or 3.1.
</p>

<p>
  The goal of this new functionality is to answer the "What's changed?"
  question in relation to the aspect-oriented structure of your
  application. Say you make a release of your project and then you
  do some refactoring such as renaming some methods, adding new methods,
  optimizing pointcuts etc. The advice in your project may now be
  matching in different places (or in additional, or in less places) but
  in anything other than very small projects it would be hard to spot this
  purely from the editor markers, Cross References view, and Visualiser
  view offered by AJDT. These views show you the current state of the
  crosscutting but not how it has changed.
</p>

<p>
  An AspectJ project in Eclipse has a crosscutting structure associated
  with it, which contains information such as the methods which are affected
  by a particular piece of advice. This information is used in AJDT to
  populate the Cross References view and to create the advice markers shown in
  the editor.  In order to be able to determine how this crosscutting structure
  has changed some time later, we first need to save out the information into
  a file. This can be done via the <b>Saving Crosscutting Map...</b> option
  on the Project menu, as shown below.

<p>
  You will then be prompted for a name for the file to store the
  crosscutting structure in. These files are given the ".ajmap" extension.
</p>

<p>
  After entering a name the map file will be created in the project.
  You can then check these map files into CVS if required, so that a
  project can have one or more crosscutting structures associated with
  it. As shown below you can open the map file in an editor, but as
  it is binary data you can't edit it (and you probably wouldn't want to
  anyway). Future versions of the map file editor could at least show
  information about the structure contained.
</p>

<p>
  If you create two map files you can compare them with each other
  by selecting
  them both in the package explorer and selecting the
  <b>Compare Crosscutting With &gt; Each Other</b> menu option.
  It is also possible to compare the crosscutting structure from one map file
  with the current structure of the project, as shown below.
</p>

alt="Screenshot showing how to initiate a comparison">

<p>
  After selecting the required menu option, the new
  <b>Crosscutting Comparison</b> view is opened and populated.
  In the example shown below something has changed since the map
  file was created which resulted in the <code>Line.setup</code>
  method being advised by advice in the <code>HistoryManagement</code>
  aspect. Either the <code>setup</code> method was added, or
  the pointcut associated with the advice was changed such that it
  now matches this method. As you can see both entries in the
  view refer to the same relationship, but from opposite directions.
  Future versions of the view will offer a relationship filter, so you
  could for example just see the "advises" relationships, and not the
  "advised by" ones.
</p>

<p>
  You can double click cells with the mouse, or use the Enter
  and arrows keys to navigate to an item listed in the Crosscutting
  Comparison view. You can also click the column headers to sort
  the table according to the contents of that column. 
</p>

<p>
  Finally the screenshot below shows another example where a number
  of crosscutting relationships have been added, and some have been
  removed. Please let us know what you think of this new functionality
  and if you have any suggestions for improving it (either via the bug,
  the AJDT newsgroup, or the ajdt-dev mailing list).
