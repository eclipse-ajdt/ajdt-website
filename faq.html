	<h2>Overview</h2>
		<ol>
		<a name="q:whatisajdt">
			<li><em>What is AJDT?</em>
		    <p>
		      The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ajdt">AspectJ Development Tools project (AJDT)</a>
		      is a set of plug-ins for Eclipse that provide support for aspect-oriented software development 
		      using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj">AspectJ</a> within the Eclipse IDE.
		    </p>
		    </li>
		</a>
	
		<a name="q:whodevelops">
			<li><em>Who develops AJDT?</em>
			<p>
		      AJDT is an open-source project hosted on eclipse.org, 
			 <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ajdt/contributors.html">current contributors</a> 
		      are listed on the website. Anyone can get involved, see
		      <a href="#q:contribute">How can I contribute to the AJDT project?</a>

		    </li>
		</a>
	
		<a name="q:aspectj">
			<li><em>How does AJDT relate to the AspectJ project?</em>
			<p>
		      AJDT provides Eclipse IDE integration for AspectJ, and includes the AJDE 
		      (AspectJ Development Environment) libraries from the AspectJ project as part of its
		      packaging. Development of the AspectJ compiler and AJDE takes place under the 
		      <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj">AspectJ project</a>.

	<h2>Using AJDT</h2>
		<ol>
		<a name="q:keywords">
			<li><em>Why aren't AspectJ keywords highlighted in the editor?</em>
		    <p>
		      The most common cause of this problem is having AspectJ constructs 
		      in Java files (files with the .java extension) and using the JDT's 
		      Java Editor. Aspects and AspectJ constructs should be contained in .aj 
		      files which are opened with the AspectJ Editor, an extension to the 
		      Java Editor.
		    </p>
		    </li>
		</a>
	
		<a name="q:debug">
			<li><em>How can I debug AspectJ programs in Eclipse?</em>
			<p>
		      AspectJ programs can be run in the debugger in the same way as Java 
		      programs. The tools enable the user to step into, through and out of 
		      advice. The AspectJ development tools also provide the facility to set 
		      breakpoints in aspects.
		    </p>
		    </li>
		</a>
	
		<a name="q:visualiser">
			<li><em>How does the Visualiser work?</em>
			<p>
		      The Visualiser is an extensible Eclipse plug-in that can be used to 
		      visualize anything that lends itself to a 'bars and stripes' style 
		      representation. In AJDT the Visualiser is used to show how aspects 
			  affect a project.  See the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ajdt/visualiser">
			  Visualiser web page</a> for more information.

	<h2>Contributing</h2>
		<ol>
		<a name="q:contribute">
			<li><em>How can I contribute to the AJDT project?</em>
		    <p>
			    Your contributions to the AJDT project are strongly welcomed! You can create a 
			    patch that fixes a bug or provides an enhancement and submit
				it to the AJDT developers either as an attachment to a bug in Bugzilla, or as an 
				attachment to a post to the newsgroup or developer mailing list.
			    You can also contribute sample code showing interesting uses of AspectJ, by adding 
			    entries to the example plug-in.
				All contributions must be made available under the 
				<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/termsofuse.html">terms of the Eclipse website</a> see
				the Eclipse 
				<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/legalfaq.html#contributions">contribution and participation FAQ</a>. Sorry, but for legal reasons
				we are unable to accept patches emailed directly to developers, and will
				 normally ask you to resubmit these either via Bugzilla or the mailing list.
				AJDT development is run as a meritocracy, developers who have a track 
				record of submitting good patches can become committers on the project.

			<li><em>How do I setup an AJDT development environment in Eclipse?</em>
			    <p>There are several stages to this: building AJDT, running the
			    correctness tests, running the performance tests, and creating an
			    Eclipse update site. The first two stages are probably sufficient
			    for most purposes. Note that the steps required for the first
			    stage depend on whether you are using Eclipse 3.0 or 3.1.</p>
			
			    <h4>Building AJDT</h4>
			
			    <p>Note first of all that in order to build AJDT you may
			    need to increase the memory available to Eclipse. This is
			    typically done by passing something like <code>"-vmargs -Xmx256m"</code> to
			    the Eclipse launcher.</p>
			
			    <p>Start with a clean workspace under Eclipse 3.0.1 or the latest
			    milestone build of Eclipse 3.1. Now open the CVS Repository Exploring 
			    perspective. Right-click on the CVS Repositories view, then click "New" > "Repository
			    Location". Host = dev.eclipse.org, Repository path =
			    /home/technology, Username = anonymous, password should be left
			    blank. Connection type = pserver. Click "Finish". Use the CVS
			    Repositories view to navigate to
			    org.eclipse.ajdt/AJDT1.2src. Select the following projects,
			    right-click and select "Check out" from the context menu:</p>
			 
			    <ul>
			      <li>org.aspectj.ajde,</li>
			      <li>org.aspectj.runtime,</li>
			      <li>org.eclipse.ajdt.core,</li>
			      <li>org.eclipse.ajdt.examples,</li>
			      <li>org.eclipse.ajdt.ui,</li>
			      <li>org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser,</li>
			      <li>org.eclipse.contribution.xref.core,</li>
			      <li>org.eclipse.contribution.xref.ui.</li>
			    </ul>
			
			    <p>Eclipse will build the projects as you import them. Some
			    projects contain source code for both Eclipse 3.0 and 3.1, so the
			    next step is to ensure the correct build configurations are being
			    used:</p>
			
			   <ul>
			     <li>Expand each of the following projects in the package explorer
			     in turn: org.eclipse.ajdt.core, and org.eclipse.ajdt.ui.</li>
			
			     <li>Eclipse 3.0: Locate the build30.ajproperties file in each
			     project, then right-click and select "Activate this
			     configuration", if it is not the active configuration
			     already. This will ensure that the 3.0.x versions of all files
			     are being built. If you installed a recent version of AJDT, the
			     build30.ajproperties files should be activated by default.</li>
			
			     <li>Eclipse 3.1: Locate the build31.ajproperties file in each
			     project, then right-click and select "Activate this
			     configuration", if it is not the active configuration
			     already. This will ensure that the 3.1 versions of all files are
			     being built. If you installed a recent version of AJDT, you will
			     need to activate all of the build31.ajproperties files, because
			     the Eclipse 3.0 versions will be chosen as the default ones.</li>
			   </ul>
			
			   <p>Now you're ready to run the plugins inside Eclipse:</p>
			
			   <ul>
			     <li>Switch to the Java Perspective if you're not already in
			     it...</li>
			
			     <li>From the run menu select "Run..."</li>
			
			     <li>Select "Run-time workbench" (this is called "Eclipse
			     Application" on Eclipse 3.1) and click new</li>
			
			     <li>Give your launch configuration a name, and click "Run"</li>
			
			     <li>Subsequent runs can simpy use the launch configuration you
			     just created</li>
			   </ul>
			
			   <h4>Running the correctness tests</h4>
			
			   <p>The next step is to add the test projects. These can be used to
			   verify that everything is okay with your environment and
			   configuration, plus of course to verify the integrity of any
			   changes you might make. Switch back to the CVS perspective and
			   check-out the following projects:</p>
			
			   <ul>
			     <li>org.eclipse.ajdt.core.tests</li>
			     <li>org.eclipse.ajdt.test</li>
			     <li>org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser.tests</li>
			     <li>org.eclipse.contribution.xref.core.test</li>
			     <li>org.eclipse.contribution.xref.ui.test</li>
			   </ul>
			
			   <p>There are two steps to running all of the tests. The
			   first is to run the AJDT core specific tests found in
			   org.eclipse.ajdt.core.tests, and the second is to run
			   the remaining tests.</p>
			
			   <p>To run the AJDT core specific tests expand the
			   org.eclipse.ajdt.core.test project, then the src folder, then the
			   org.eclipse.ajdt.core.tests package. Now select the AllAJDTCoreTests.java file,
			   right-click and select "Run As" &gt; "JUnit Plug-in Test". A new
			   runtime workbench should then be launched and the tests run inside
			   that. Progress and test results can be observed from the JUnit
			   Eclipse view.</p>
			   
			   <p>You can then run all of the remaining tests by expanding the
			   org.eclipse.ajdt.test project, then the testsrc folder, then the
			   org.eclipse.ajdt.test package. Now select the AllTests.java file,
			   right-click and select "Run As" &gt; "JUnit Plug-in Test". A new
			   runtime workbench should then be launched and the tests run inside
			   that. Progress and test results can be observed from the JUnit
			   Eclipse view.</p>
			
			   <p>Now you're ready to start enhancing the plugins by adding to or
			   extending the code in your projects - just use run (or debug) to
			   try out your changes. When you have a patch to submit to the
			   project, go to the "Team" item in the project context menu and
			   select "Create Patch...". Naturally the correctness tests should
			   also be run, and new tests written to accompany fixes or new
			   features.</p>
			
			   <h4>Running the performance tests</h4>
			
			   <p>Work is underway on a new plugin,
			   org.eclipse.ajdt.tests.performance, to monitor the performance of
			   every build of AJDT. This plugin has dependencies on a number of
			   Eclipse test projects, which are not shipped in the base Eclipse
			   SDK. These instructions will be updated later when the plugin is
			   fully up and running.
			
			   <h4>Creating an update site</h4>
			
			   <p>Each of the AJDT plugin projects also contains an Ant build
			   file, "build.xml." The default target builds a packaged version of
			   the project in question. Check-out the "UpdateSite" project from
			   CVS, and use the build.xml file in that project to invoke a master
			   build that builds an entire update site structure in its "dist"
			   directory. To run the build.xml file inside Eclipse, you need to do
			   "Run As > Ant Build..." to bring up the run configuration dialog,
			   then go to the "JRE" tab and select "Run in the same JRE as the
			   workspace". This is required for the "eclipse.incrementalBuild" Ant
			   task to work.</p>
			
			   <p>You can now test the built update site as follows:</p>
			
			   <ul>
			     <li>Copy the contents of the dist directory to a clean directory,
			     outside of your workspace. For example, "ajupdate."</li>
			
			     <li>From the help menu of the Eclipse in which you wish to
			     install the AspectJ feature, choose "Help" &gt; "Software
			     Updates" &gt; "Find and Install..." and follow the steps outlined
			     earlier in this section.</li>
			   </ul>
		    </li>
		</a>
		
		<a name="q:packaging">
			<li><em>How can I package my sample code for contribution to the examples plug-in?</em>
				<p>
				    The org.eclipse.ajdt.examples plugin contains various sample projects which 
				    are made available under
				    the Examples category of the New wizard, from where they can be imported into 
				    your workspace as AspectJ projects.
				    It is easy to add new samples to this plugin, as follows:
				    <ul>
				    	<li>Create a jar file containing your source code, and at least one build c
				    	onfiguration file. Place this
				    		in the archive folder of the examples plugin.
				    	<li>Add an entry to the plugin.xml file for your sample project, by copying 
				    	one of the existing entries.
				    	<li>Change the src attribute of the import element to refer to your jar 
				    	file, and change the title,
				    		description, pagetitle, and pagedescription property names as appropriate, and add
				    		corresponding entries to the plugin.properties file.
				    	<li>Change the build attribute to refer to your default build configuration 
				    	file. Your project may contain
				    	    more configurations but the one specified here will be the one used to 
				    	    initially build the project.
				    	<li>Optionally, you can specify an open attribute to the projectsetup element, 
				    	which refers to a file,
				    	    such as a README file, which is opened after the project has been imported 
				    	    to the workspace.   
				    </ul>
