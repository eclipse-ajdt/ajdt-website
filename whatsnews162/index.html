<td>
	Through the use of <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/incubator/aspects/index.php">Equinox Aspects</a>, AJDT is able to weave into Eclipse and hook in to existing functionality that was not exposed before.  For more information on what capabilities the JDT Weaving plugin provides AJDT, see <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/JDT_weaving_features">the wiki</a>.  And <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/JDT_weaving_implementation">read here</a> for more information on how the plugin is implemented.

<tr><td valign="top"><b>ITD aware content assist</b> (.aj files only)</td>
<td>
	<p>Inter Type Declared methods, fields, and constructors are available in content assist.  Similarly, appropriate declarations from declare parent super types are available in content assist.</p>

	<p>Currently, this functionality is only available in AJ Editors for *.aj files.  Also, the project is required to have had a successful build.  Making this work in *.java files is a top priority for the next AJDT release.</p>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>ITD aware reconciling</b> (.aj and .java)</td>
<td>
	Intertype declaration aware reconciling and eager parsing are now available in both AJ and Java editors.  This means that ITD references in a compilation unit opened in a Java editor will no longer show spurious error bars.  Furthermore, AJ editors now provide the same kind of eager error detection as you type that is available in Java editors.

<tr><td valign="top"><b>ITD aware super-type hierarchies</b></td>
<td>
	<p>The type hierarchy view now shows types inserted into the hierarchy through a declare parents declaration.</p>
	<p>Note that in this release, AJDT can only show *super* types that have been declared by declare parents.  The sub-type hierarchy is not yet ITD aware.</p>
