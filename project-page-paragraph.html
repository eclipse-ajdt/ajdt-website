Some aspects of system implementation, such as logging, error handling,
standards enforcement and feature variations are notoriously difficult
to implement in a modular way. The result is that code is tangled across
a system and leads to quality, productivity and maintenance problems.
Aspect Oriented Software Development enables the clean modularization of
these crosscutting concerns.

The AspectJ Development Tools (AJDT) project provides Eclipse platform
based tool support for AOSD with AspectJ. Our goal is to deliver a user
experience that is consistent with the Java Development Tools (JDT) when
working with AspectJ projects and resources.
