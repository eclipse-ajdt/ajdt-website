			<td valign="top"><b>Overview</b></td>
			<td valign="top">In this release, we have focussed on searching
			and refactoring support for Intertype Declarations (ITDs) and Declare
			declarations. This will particularly benefit users of <a
				href="http://www.springsource.org/roo">Spring Roo</a> who will be
			better able to search and refactor source code that contains
			Roo-style aspects.</td>

			<h3>Searching</h3>
			</td>

		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>Searching and hovers for ITD target
			types</b></td>
			<td>Target types of intertype declarations now appear in the
			search results when searching for type references: <br />
			<br />
			<img src="img/search_itd_target_type.png" border="1" /><br />
			Notice here that simple as well as fully qualified names are found
			through searches.<br>
			<br />
			Similarly, hovering over ITD target types will display its type
			information: <br />
			<br />
			<img src="img/hover_itd_target_type.png" border="1" /> <br />
			Navigation (i.e., hyperlinks and F3) works as well.</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>Searching inside Declare parents</b></td>
			<td>Types referenced inside of declare parents declarations are
			also returned in search results where appropriate: <br />
			<br />
			<img src="img/search_declare_parents.png" border="1" /></td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>Searching inside Declare annotation</b></td>
			<td>And finally, types referenced inside of declare annotation
			declarations are similarly found when searching for references: <br />
			<br />
			<img src="img/search_declare_annotation.png" border="1" /><br />
			<br />
			The annotation itself is also found through searching: <br />
			<br />
			<img src="img/search_declare_annotation2.png" border="1" /><br />
			<br />
			There are some limitations to these new searching features:
			<ul>
				<li>Wild cards are not supported.</li>
				<li>Type bindings are sometimes not respected, meaning that two
				types with the same name, but different packages may be
				inappropriately matched. You will notice that the search result for
				<code>@Loggable</code> inside of the <code>declare parents</code> is
				marked as potential. This means that we could not match on the fully
				qualified name, but only the type's simple name.</li>
				<li>Field and method references in declare annotations are not
				returned in search results. See, <a
					href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=327117">Bug
				327117</a>.</li>
				<li>Hovers and navigation are not yet implemented inside of
				declare declarations.
			</ul>

			<h3>Refactoring</h3>
			</td>
		</tr>


		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>Rename refactoring</b></td>
			<td>Rename refactoring is working in almost all situations.
			Intertype declarations can be renamed; fields, methods, and types
			referenced inside of Aspects will be appropriately renamed; and
			AspectJ Compilation units will be renamed when appropriate. Most of
			this work was completed for the <a href="../whatsnew210/index.html">2.1.0
			release</a>, with some small fixes included in this release. <br>
			<br>
			The most significant improvement in this area is that package renames
			are properly reflected in fully qualified names that are referenced
			in aspects: <br />
			<br />
			<img src="img/rename_package.png" border="1" /> <br />
			<br />
			AJDT does not currently support the renaming of named pointcuts.</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>Move refactoring</b></td>
			<td>Similarly, move refactoring is AspectJ-aware. Import
			statements and fully qualified names will be properly updated in
			Aspects when types and compilation units move. For example, moving 
			a type referenced by an Aspect will force import statements to be
			added/removed and fully qualified names to be updated:
			<br/><br/> 
			<img src="img/move_cu.png" border="1" />
			<br/><br/>
			Note that you will sometimes receive an error message like this:
			<br/><br/>
			<img src="img/potential_matches.png" border="1" />
			<br/><br/>
			This message means that there are some type reference matches that 
			the refactoring is not sure about.  This happens because there are
			some situations where AJDT cannot determine type bindings and performs
			matches on simple, rather than qualified, names.  This message can generally
			be ignored, but you may want to examine all changes to make sure.
			<br/><br/>
			It is also possible to
			drag and drop types, fields, and methods into aspects, with the same
			behavior as you would expect when the project is pure Java.
			For example, when dragging and dropping a type into an AspectJ
			compilation unit, fully qualifed references to that type are properly
			updated: <br />
			<br />
			<img src="img/move_type_into_aspect.png" border="1" /> <br />
			<br />
			Note that currently, only drag and dropping of fields and methods
			into aspects are working. Using the Move Refactoring wizard is
			throwing exceptions.</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>Catalog of working refactorings in AJ
			files</b></td>
			<td>In this release, we have done significant work in making
			sure that the standard JDT refactorings are available when inside an
			Aspect. We have focussed on the more widely used refactorings, and
			left some of the less popular refactorings unimplemented. In addition
			to the AspectJ-specific <strong>Push in</strong> and <strong>Pull
			out</strong> refactorings, and the standard <strong>Rename</strong> and <strong>Move</strong>
			here are the JDT refactorings that are currently known to work in
			AJDT:

			<ul>
				<li>Extract Class</li>
				<li>Pull up</li>
				<li>Push down</li>
				<li>Use super type where possible</li>
				<li>Inline</li>
				<li>Extract Method</li>
				<li>Extract Local Variable</li>
				<li>Extract Constant</li>
				<li>Introduce indirection</li>
				<li>Introduce parameter (non-advice)</li>
			</ul>

			The following refactorings will produce correct results, even though
			the refactoring wizard complains about compilation errors:
			<ul>
				<li>Change method signature</li>
				<li>Introduce Parameter Object (inside non-ITD method)</li>
			</ul>

			And finally, the following refactorings produce errors and do not
			work inside aspects:

			<ul>
				<li>Extract super class</li>
				<li>Infer generic arguments where possible</li>
				<li>Introduce Parameter (inside advice)</li>
				<li>Introduce Parameter Object</li>
				<li>Convert Local variable to a field</li>
				<li>Encapsulate field</li>
				<li>Move type to new file, when the type is an inner type of an Aspect</li>
				<li>Move static field or method into aspect (using move wizard,
				drag and drop is working)</li>
			</ul>

			If you want us to fix any of the above refactorings, or you notice a
			problem with one of the existing refactorings, please notify us on
			the mailing list or raise a bugzilla request for it.</td>
